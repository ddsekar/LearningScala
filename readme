nquiry Regarding Father's Demat Account - Disclosure Requirement

Dear Employer Compliance Department,

I am writing to inquire about the necessity of disclosing my father's demat account. I recently became aware of this account. My father is currently employed and financially independent, and he does not reside with me. Furthermore, he has not engaged in any investment activities within this account for some time, as you can see from the attached transaction statement covering the period from its inception to the present date.

Given these circumstances, I would appreciate your guidance on whether I am required to disclose this information to the company.

Thank you for your time and assistance with this matter.

Sincerely,
